Tzu-Chun Kuo, "Evaluating Californian Under-Age Drunk Driving Laws:
Endogenous Policy Lags", Journal of Applied Econometrics, Vol. 27, No. 7,
2012, pp. 1100-1115.

Information on traffic mortality during 1984 and 2002 was obtained from 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatal Accident 
Report System (http://www.nhtsa.gov/FARS). The fatality rates were 
defined per 10,000 persons in the Californian population, including both 
alcohol and non-alcohol-related crashes. The Californian population can 
be found at 
(http://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Documents/VSC-2005-0101.pdf).

The dependent variable for the evaluation of under-age driving laws is 
the fatality rate of people under the age of 21 and is held in a 
variable named "FR_Y". The fatality rate for people between 22 and 24 
years old was introduced as the control group and is held in a variable 
named "FR_O". This study analyzed the policy effects using both 
quarterly and monthly fatality rates. Therefore, two files are included.

The fatality rates for the two groups exhibit substantial seasonal 
variation. Therefore, a seasonal adjustment has been applied. The 
seasonal adjustment was done by using EVIEWS 3.1 Version with Census 
X-11 approach.

There are two data files. The monthly data are in tck-data-m.txt, and 
the quarterly data are in tck-data-q.txt. These are both ASCII files in 
DOS format. They are zipped in the file tck-data.zip. Unix/Linux users 
should use "unzip -a".
